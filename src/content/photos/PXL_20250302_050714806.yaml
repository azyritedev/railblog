detail: >-
  Two connected train carriages side-by-side at a station platform. Both doors which
  are yellow and have a copper-tinted window are closed. The carriages are made of
  corrugated stainless steel with a light-blue line around window-height as part of
  the livery. The ends of each carriage is painted in a dark blue colour, and the
  connector between the carriages is black. It is daytime and the sky is overcast.
notes: Aren't those copper-tinted windows just gorgeous?
