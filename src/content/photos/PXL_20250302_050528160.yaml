  This image shows a blue and yellow power car at a station platform. The front
  of the power car is prominent, with a streamlined design, albeit a bit dirty.
  The nose of the train is curved, with the number "2014" painted on the front in
  white numbering. The train's body is primarily blue, with a lighter blue wave
  pattern running from the middle to the rear. The platform is visible in the
  foreground, with square tiles arranged in a grid pattern. In the background,
  a dark-colored train compartment can be seen. The sky above is slightly overcast.
