detail: >-
  A steel double-decker 8-car suburban "Tangara" train with a yellow and black 
  front, and yellow doors passes under an overhead wire gantry on the centre 
  right track out of four tracks. The red target plate on the front of the train
  indicates T97 while the destination board is empty, presumably broken. Some 
  short buildings can be seen to the left and right of the rail corridor with 
  some light graffiti. The sky is a light blue colour with some clouds and the 
  lighting is that of a sunset from the left.
