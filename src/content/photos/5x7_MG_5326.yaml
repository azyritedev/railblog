  The orange, black and silver rear of a double-decker Mariyung intercity train
  stopped at a short concrete platform. The train's electronic destination board
  above its clean windshield reads "Central". This photo is taken at a low angle
  on the tracks, looking up at the train. The train is on the left track, while
  the right track and other platform is unoccupied. The platform has a small
  shelter, a wooden bench and a fence along a ramp. The sky is mostly clear and
  the background appears densly forrested.
