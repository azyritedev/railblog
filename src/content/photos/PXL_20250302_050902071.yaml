  This image shows a close-up of a blue and yellow long train at a station. The
  front of the train is prominent, with a streamlined design. The nose of the 
  train is curved, with the number "2019" displayed on the front in white. The 
  train's body is primarily blue, with a lighter blue wave pattern running from 
  the middle to the rear. The platform is visible in the foreground, with square
  tiles arranged in a grid pattern. In the background, a dark-colored train 
  carriage of a Tangara can be seen. The sky above is slightly overcast, with some 
  buildings visible in the background. The overall atmosphere appears to be a 
  busy, modern train station.
