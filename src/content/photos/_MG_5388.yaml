detail: >-
  Looking into the rail corridor from the end of the platform, a signal can be 
  seen prominently to the left of the frame, displaying two red aspects with a 
  small board reading "SM5961" in between the two signals on the pole. Two tracks
  are immediately to the right side of the signal toward the bottom centre of the
  frame, with a pair of offset signals facing the other direction visible on the
  far right of the image, for the right track. Two more tracks can be seen merging
  into the rail corridor further ahead, and overhead wires and gantries fill the 
  top of the image.
