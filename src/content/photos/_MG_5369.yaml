detail: >-
  A modern Mariyung double-decker intercity train travelling away from the camera
  with the rear of the train visible, along curved tracks on top of a causeway.
  There is a pair of tracks, and the train is travelling on the left track.
  The train is mostly silver with orange-accented doors and black highlights. The
  electronic destination board is labelled "Newcastle Intg". Overhead wires are
  visible with a rusty supporting pole out of focus to the left of the frame. In
  the foreground, a bright blue telephone box and some locked steel boxes are
  visible. The background has green forested hills and a body of water 
  (Mullet Creek) is visible to the right of the causeway. The sky is clear with 
  scattered clouds and it is broad daylight.
