  A yellow, red and grey V set on taking up the right side of the frame at the
  intercity platforms of Central station. The front and some of the side of the
  train is visible. The side of the train is made of corrugated stainless steel
  and is largely unpainted. On the front, the words "Intercity" and "Transport
  NSW TrainLink" are marked in white paint. The photo is taken at night, with an
  almost completely dark sky whilst the platforms are brightly lit by the station
  lights. 
notes: >- 
  This was the final Central-bound V set. The final ever V set on the CCN departed
  Central for Newcastle at about 9:20-30pm the same day. A cheeky farewell poster
  can be seen stuck on the emergency exit door's window.
