title: Tangara proceeding after receiving double greens at signal SM 5961
date: 2025-07-12 # unknown time
detail: >-
  A double-decker suburban electric "Tangara" train is seen departing, passing a
  prominent green on green (double green) signal to the left of the frame. The 
  doors of this train are bright yellow with the body being a stainless steel
  silver and the windows being a reflective black, whilst the upper floor windows
  curve slightly. Only the first carriage and half of the second carriage are
  visible. The shot was taken looking out at the end of the platform into the 
  rail corridor but no parts of the platform itself are actually visible. 
  Overhead wires and some supporting equipment are visible toward the top of the
  frame along with the pantograph attached to the end of the first carriage.
notes: >-
  All pax were moved from this train onto the train on platform 3 (this is on plt 5) instead to 
  continue their trip toward Bondi Jn while this train was boarded by multiple police and
  searched â€” resulting in some transpositions and delays. The police did not appear
  to find anything and after a while the train was cleared to continue which is
  depicted in this photo here.
