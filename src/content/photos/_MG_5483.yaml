detail: >-
  A small shiny rectangular steel plate reading "TANGARA" in uppercase writing,
  and reading "Designed and Manufactured by A. Goninan & Co. Limited Newcastle
  N.S.W." under it in smaller print. The plate is held into place with two 
  bolts at the centre of each side. The background is a clear white colour and 
  the image appears a bit dark. A bit of a green exit sticker is visible to the 
  left of the frame but is cut off.
