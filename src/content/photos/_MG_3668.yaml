detail: >-
  A white, blue and yellow track inspection vehicle (TIV) sitting behind a fence,
  stabled in a workshop. A double-decker steel K-set is visible behind the TIV.
  The upper half of the frame is filled with various gantries and supports that
  hold up the overhead wires in the area. A couple pairs of tracks are visible
  in the lower half of the frame.
notes: >- 
  I'm not sure how many of these TIVs there are but I certainly don't see them
  very often
