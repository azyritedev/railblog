title: Security camera at Berowra
detail: >-
  A metal pole supporting a white round security camera can be seen, with the 
  security camera mounted to the right of the pole so it occupies the centre of
  the frame. The photo is taken from the ground looking upward so only the top
  of the pole, the camera and the sky are visible. A thick black wire runs from
  the side of the camera to the pole. The sky is a mostly clear blue colour with
  some wispy clouds visible to the far left of the frame. 
notes: The reflection of the camera has been edited to remove myself
