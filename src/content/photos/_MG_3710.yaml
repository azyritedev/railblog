detail: >-
  A yellow, black and silver double-decker Tangara train at the platform. The
  rear of the train is visible, which has a slanted flat design which is yellow
  and black below the windshield. A red target plate is visible reading "T5".
  Above the windshield is an empty (probably broken) destination board. Only the
  rear two carriages are visible in the frame, with yellow doors and a curved
  window design on the top floor. The scene is brightly lit with ample sunshine
  and the sky is an overexposed white colour. There are apartment buildings
  visible in the background.
