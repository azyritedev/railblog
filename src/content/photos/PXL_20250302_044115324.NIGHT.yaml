detail: >-
  The interior of the train. It is clean and brightly lit, with white walls and
  ceiling and reversible blue-patterned fabric chairs in a 3-2 configuration.
  The chairs have a headrest and yellow handles on aisle seats. Large clear 
  windows line both sides, providing views of the station platform outside. 
  The station appears empty, and natural daylight fills the carriage.
