  A modern double-decker train passing the platform threshold at a semi-rural 
  station surrounded by trees. the train's front is primarily black with silver
  bumpers and a red accent below the three-section windshield, and an electronic
  destination display reading "Newcastle Intg" above the windshield. A platform
  can be seen to the right of the train with some tactile paving and safety 
  lettering in black reading "Stand Behind the Yellow Line", out of focus. To 
  the left of the train are two more tracks and there are overhead wires supported
  by a gantry just beyond the platform's end.
