title: D62 leading an up CCN service terminating at Hornsby due to trackwork
detail: >-
  A double-decker Mariyung train travelling along a railway line with trees and
  two white shipping containers in the background. The train is viewed side on
  with only the front and first door visible, featuring a prominent curved design
  and a silver body with red-orange accents on the doors and front. The destination
  board above the windscreen on the front of the train reads 'Hornsby'. Overhead
  wires are visible to the top of the frame, and it is a clear sunny day.
notes: >-
  Due to trackwork on the day, CCN services only ran between Hornsby and Newcastle,
  with T9/T1 stopping all stops between Ashfield and Macdonaldtown until later that
  evening.
