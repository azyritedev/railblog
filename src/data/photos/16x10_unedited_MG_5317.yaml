detail: >-
  A new orange, silver and black double decker "Mariyung" intercity train 
  traveling along tracks on a causeway next to Mullet Creek. The tracks are 
  curved, with only the first and a bit of the second carriage visible as the 
  train is approaching the camera on the further of two tracks. Overhead wires 
  are visible and a rusted gantry can be seen behind the train. The background 
  is forested and there are hills. The sky is a dull clear colour.
