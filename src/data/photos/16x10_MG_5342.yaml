detail: >- 
  A white, dark blue and yellow freight locomotive with the lettering 
  'RF' on the front of it leads a long container train around a curve, 
  with yellow and red shipping containers visible behind the train. 
  The track is on a low causeway with a creek visible to the right of the frame.
  The front of the train is just passing under a rusted overhead wiring gantry. 
  Green forested hills are visible in the background.
