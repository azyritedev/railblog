  An electronic passenger information screen mounted near the ceiling, bordered
  in black. Displayed on the screen is stop information, showing that the next
  stop is "Hawkesbury R", and that the proceeding stations are Cowan (only accessible
  from Cars 5-8) in 10 minutes and Berowra in 15 minutes. Above the list of stations
  the current time is shown as 13:21 and on the far right of the screen the car
  number is listed in as "Car 7". The ceiling panels are a clean white colour 
  and an out of focus bright yellow grab handle is visible to the top of the 
  frame. The overall lighting is warm.
